Automatically unlock and complete all tasks and lessons in the Unicredit Startup Your Life educational platform, saving you hours of tedious clicking.

## üîç What it does

This tool automates the process of completing learning modules in the Unicredit Startup Your Life platform by:

- Logging into your account securely
- Navigating through each module in the specified curriculum
- Systematically marking each lesson as viewed and completed
- Handling special cases like first and last lessons in modules
- Implementing intelligent retry mechanisms for failed attempts
- Providing detailed progress logs throughout the process

## ‚ú® Features

- **Efficient Automation**: Completes all lessons in minutes instead of hours
- **Two-Phase Processing**: Special handling for regular lessons and module-ending lessons
- **Robust Error Handling**: Retries failed operations with progressively longer delays
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed console output showing completion status
- **Headful Mode**: Watch the browser as it works through your modules
- **Configurable Modules**: Easily select which modules to complete

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Playwright for Python
- Valid Unicredit Startup Your Life account credentials

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aleeeh07/unicredit-bypass.git
cd unicredit-bypass

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install playwright asyncio
playwright install chromium
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script with your login credentials:

```bash
python automator.py --username your.email@example.com --password yourpassword
```

### Customizing modules

To select which modules to complete, edit the `modules_data` dictionary in the script:

```python
modules_data = {
    "310": [659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667],
    "311": [668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679],
    # Add or remove modules as needed
}
```

## ‚ùó Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `XSRF token not found` | Failed to capture authentication token | Try clearing browser cookies and cache, then run again |
| `Failed: Unauthorized access` | Invalid credentials or session expired | Verify your username and password are correct |
| `TimeoutError` | Page took too long to load | Check your internet connection and try again |
| `Error loading module page` | Module might be inaccessible | Verify the module exists and you have access to it |
| `Retry failed for lesson` | Multiple attempts to unlock lesson failed | The platform might be experiencing issues, try again later |

## üîÑ How it Works

1. The script launches a browser and logs into the platform
2. It captures the authentication token needed for API requests
3. Phase 1: Processes all regular lessons in each module
   - Visits each lesson page
   - Sends API requests to mark content as viewed
   - Marks each lesson as completed
4. Phase 2: Handles the final lesson of each module (which requires special processing)
5. Reports detailed statistics on successful completions
